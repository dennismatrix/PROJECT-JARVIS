# PROJECT-JARVIS

A sophisticated Python prototype inspired by JARVIS from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This project aims to simulate an intelligent assistant capable of understanding natural language, automating tasks, and providing contextual information—all within a modular, extensible framework.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Interact with Jarvis using conversational commands.
- **Task Automation**: Automate daily routines, reminders, emails, and more.
- **Context Awareness**: Jarvis can respond based on current context and user preferences.
- **Extensible Modules**: Easily add new skills or integrations (e.g., weather, news, smart home).
- **Secure & Private**: Handles user data responsibly, with options for offline operation.

## Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dennismatrix/PROJECT-JARVIS.git
cd PROJECT-JARVIS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Jarvis
python jarvis.py
```

## Example Usage

```text
User: "Jarvis, remind me to call Tony at 3 PM."
Jarvis: "Reminder set for 3 PM to call Tony."

User: "What's the weather today?"
Jarvis: "Today's forecast: Sunny, 25°C in your area."
```

## Architecture

- **Core Engine**: Orchestrates command parsing, intent recognition, and module routing.
- **Modules**: Plug-and-play Python classes for new skills (e.g., reminders, search, smart devices).
- **Configurable Database**: Stores preferences, history, and user data securely.
