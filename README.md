PROJECT-JARVIS is a sophisticated Python-based AI assistant, inspired by Marvel's JARVIS. It features natural language understanding, contextual awareness, and modular extensibility. Designed for voice, text, and UI interaction, it can automate daily tasks, answer questions, and learn from user input.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice & Text Interaction:** Talk or type commands to JARVIS.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Understands user intent via BERT and neural network modules.
- **Modular Skills:** Add new capabilities easily (e.g., reminders, notes, information retrieval).
- **Contextual Memory:** Remembers conversations and tasks.
- **UI Component:** Optional graphical interface for desktop use.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Memory and keys managed separately.
